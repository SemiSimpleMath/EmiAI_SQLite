Time Entry Narrative Style Guide

1) What a "time entry block" is
- A time entry block contains one or more narratives.
- Narratives describe work performed in present, active voice (imperative verb lead).

Examples of acceptable verb leads:
- Prepare, develop, determine, evaluate, perform, analyze, validate, reconcile, integrate, standardize.

2) Formatting rules

A) Single narrative block
Format
- One sentence.
- No semicolon.
- Ends with a period.
- No time in parentheses inside the sentence.
- Optional: include time after the period in brackets for clarity.

Example
- Attend analytics team meeting. [ ]

B) Multi narrative block (2+ narratives)
Format
- Narratives separated by semicolon + space: "; "
- Only the first narrative starts with a capital letter.
- Every narrative after the semicolon starts with a lowercase letter.
- Each narrative includes time in parentheses at the end, immediately before the semicolon or period: "( )"
- The final narrative ends with a period.

Example
- Prepare analysis environment ( ); integrate payroll data into the analysis framework ( ).

3) Voice and grammar rules

A) Present active voice
- Use active, present tense, verb-first phrasing.
- Avoid "I", "we", and passive constructions.

Prefer
- Prepare methodology to...
- Develop framework to...
- Evaluate data to...
- Perform analysis to...

Avoid
- Wrote code to...
- Ran scripts to...
- Was able to...
- Strategy / strategize (unless truly strategic).

B) No adjectives that claim effort or scope
- Avoid words like: comprehensive, thorough, robust, extensive.
- Clients assume those by default.

C) Avoid "simple task descriptions"
Do not describe the mechanics of the work (especially coding) unless it is truly the work product.

Replace
- "write and run code to clean X"

With
- "prepare methodology for interpreting, standardizing, and comparing X"

4) Content rules (what to say)

A) Emphasize expertise and methodology
Each narrative should communicate:
- Analytical intent (why the work matters)
- Methodology/framework (how it is approached at a professional level)
- Business/legal purpose (exposure, violations, claims/defenses, class metrics)

B) Use "methodology" language when appropriate
Common, reusable patterns:
- Prepare methodology for...
- Develop methodology to evaluate...
- Determine assumptions, variables, and analytical framework for...
- Perform quality control assessment of...
- Prepare alternate methodology for...

C) Avoid stating low-level implementation unless necessary
Generally avoid:
- write code, run code, pull data, move files, clean up columns

Prefer:
- integrate, reconcile, standardize, validate, assess, evaluate, develop, prepare

5) Rewrite patterns (Bad -> Good)

Coding and cleaning
- Bad: Write code to bring the timecard data to a form where analysis can be run.
  Good: Prepare timecard data for use in violation analysis and in assessment of potential exposure.

- Bad: write and run code to clean census, timecard and payroll data.
  Good: Prepare methodologies for interpreting, standardizing, and comparing timecard, payroll, and census data sets.

"Set up" language
- Bad: Set up analysis environment and customize the configuration.
  Good: Determine assumptions, variables, and specific methodologies for data analysis and interpretation framework.

Missing data handling
- Bad: Strategize how to handle missing employees...
  Good: Perform quality control analysis on potentially missing data sources.

Extrapolation / imputation
- Bad: use statistical methods to extrapolate... then impute...
  Good: Prepare supplemental statistical extrapolation of baseline case metrics and potential violations.

Alternate assumptions
- Bad: perform another exposure analysis by assuming...
  Good: Prepare alternate violation analysis methodology for missing shift data.

"Methodology for analyzing..."
- Bad: Conduct analysis of identifiers and their recurrences within the payroll dataset.
  Good: Prepare methodology for analyzing identifiers and their recurrences within the payroll dataset.

Standardized "harmonize" rewrite
- Bad: Harmonize timecard data for further analysis.
  Good: Prepare methodology for interpretation and standardization of timecard data for further analysis.
