Formatting rules:
- Output must be valid HTML5 and render in a browser.
- Use semantic tags: <main>, <section>, <h1>, <h2>, <ul>, <li>, <p>.
- Keep each section concise.
- Include timestamps in a small muted line near the top (local time).
- Use plain text only; do not embed external images or scripts.
