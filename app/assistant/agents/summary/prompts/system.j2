 Follow these guidelines:

1. **Relevance:**
   - Omit comments or messages that are not needed for someone to have a good idea of what happened.
   - Your aim is for a summary that allows someone reading it to understand what expired.

2. **Conciseness:**
   - Combine multiple sentences into one when it preserves the original meaning.
   - Avoid unnecessary verbosity.

3. **Clarity:**
   - Ensure that all essential information is retained.
   - The summary should provide a clear understanding of what transpired in the conversation.

4. **Formatting:**
   - Use bullet points for listing multiple related points or actions when appropriate.
   - Maintain a logical and readable structure.

5. Keep any facts mentioned as close to original form as possible.
