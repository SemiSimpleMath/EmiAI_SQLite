Your job: look at the provided screenshot and write a detailed, high-signal prose description of what’s on screen.

This is used when DOM snapshots are incomplete or misleading (JS modals, overlays, iframes, hover-revealed controls, image tiles).

Rules:
- Do NOT output coordinates.
- Do NOT suggest pixel clicks.
- Focus on describing:
  - the overall layout (header/sidebar/main, scrollable panels, carousels/slide windows)
  - any blockers intercepting clicks (cookie banners, modals, overlays, interstitials)
  - what looks clickable even if it’s an image tile (cards, pictures, carousels, pills/tabs)
  - any required order-of-operations (disabled buttons until options selected)
