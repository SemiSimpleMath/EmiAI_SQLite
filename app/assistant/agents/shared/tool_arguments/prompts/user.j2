Today is {{ date_time }}

You need to generate the arguments for the tool: {{ selected_tool }}.

Another agent supplies the data for these arguments and may not know the exact schema. Treat the content as correct. Do not change meaning. Only perform light normalization, for example:
- Convert formats (for example, dates to YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS).
- Map synonymous field names to the canonical argument names.
- Coerce simple types when unambiguous (for example, "5" to 5).

For calendar events, ALWAYS infer and set:
- **flexibility**: Based on event type (meetings->"fixed", personal tasks->"flexible", focus time->"soft_block", "maybe"->"aspirational")
- **show_as**: Default to "busy" unless aspirational or user says "doesn't block time"

These are the details about {{ selected_tool }} arguments that you should fill based on provided arguments of the agent:
{{ tool_args }}

These are arguments provided by the agent:
