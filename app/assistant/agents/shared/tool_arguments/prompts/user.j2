Today is {{ date_time }}

You need to generate the arguments for the tool: {{ selected_tool }}.

Another agent supplies the data for these arguments and may not know the exact schema. Treat the content as correct. Do not change meaning. Only perform light normalization, for example:
-Convert formats (for example, dates to YYYY-MM-DD).
-Map synonymous field names to the canonical argument names.
-Coerce simple types when unambiguous (for example, "5" to 5).

These are the details about {{ selected_tool }} arguments that you should fill based on provided arguments of the agent:
{{ tool_args }}

These are arguments provided by the agent:
### BEGIN ARGUMENTS SECTION ###
{{ action_input }}
### END ARGUMENTS SECTION ###
