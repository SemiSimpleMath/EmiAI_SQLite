Very powerful node finding agent.  You give it a description in prose as to what you are looking for.

You can say you want all educational nodes connected to Jukka node.

But bets input is just to carefully describe the context and what you want the results to be like.  Let the agent determine the filters.

Note: This agent will only find you minimal information.  It is up to you to hydrate the nodes if needed.
