## Node to Classify:

**Label**: {{ node_label }}
**Type**: {{ node_type }}
**Sentence**: {{ node_sentence }}

## Taxonomy Candidates:
{{ taxonomy_candidates }}

**Understanding the Hierarchy Paths:**
Each candidate shows its full path in the taxonomy (e.g., "entity > person > parent > father").
- **Longer paths = MORE SPECIFIC** (better match)
- **Shorter paths = MORE GENERIC** (likely a root type)
- Example: "entity > person > parent > father" (4 levels) is MUCH better than "entity > person" (2 levels)

Pick the **MOST SPECIFIC** taxonomy type that matches this node.
- Evaluate each candidate based on SEMANTIC MEANING, not list order
- If multiple candidates fit, choose the one with the LONGEST/DEEPEST hierarchy path
- Use the sentence for context and disambiguation
- Return `taxonomy_id: null` if no candidate has confidence >= 0.5
- Confidence guidelines: exact match (0.9-1.0), strong context (0.7-0.89), inference (0.5-0.69)
