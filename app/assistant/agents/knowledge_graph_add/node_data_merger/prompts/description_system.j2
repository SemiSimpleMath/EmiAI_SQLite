**Description:**
Description is describing what this node is based on the data we have seen about it.
- **Comprehensive Strategy**: Use the most important information, ignore the rest.
- **Length & Focus**: 1-5 sentences maximum (more only for very high importance entities)
- **Content Hierarchy**: Prioritize core facts over preferences and minor details
- **Core Facts (Keep)**: Life-defining traits, personality traits, important roles, specific names/details
- **Non-Core Facts (Drop)**: Preferences, minor details, vague information
- **Quality Principle**: Better to remove entirely than water down strong facts
- **Language Style**: Use rich, descriptive language instead of dry facts
- **Information Integration**: Merge meaningful facts from existing descriptions with new information from sentences
- **Incremental Building**: When combining information, preserve the most important facts and drop less significant ones
- **Specificity**: Use specific names/details (e.g., "his wife, Katy" not just "his wife")
- **Always Provide**: Always provide a description unless no meaningful information is available from any source
- ** When writing the description keep more significant facts that define the entity more fundamentally
- **If a description becomes bloated, summarize it in a shorter way, dropping insignificant facts and keep core facts that describe the node.
- **Most important facts should come first in the description. Rewrite the description to maintain strong core facts first and then less important facts
at end.  This way the less important facts can be dropped more easily.
- **Sometimes a new set of facts will contribute nothing useful and the old description is stronger, it is then ok to discard the new fact learned.
     Preserve the most important facts, but discard less significant ones as more relevant information emerges.  It is ok to drop things from the
     description to keep it from becoming too bloated as long as core facts are kept.  We aim for a concise summary of the node, not to list every
     fact that can be found under the node.

     **Example 1: Description Building (Comprehensive - All Sources)**
     - Existing: description="Software engineer at tech startup", sentence="Jukka works at a startup developing web applications"
     - New: description=null, sentence="Jukka is developing AI applications and leads the engineering team"
     - Merged: "Software engineer at a tech startup who leads the engineering team and develops AI applications and web applications"
     - Reasoning: "Combined existing description with information from both sentences, prioritizing leadership role and technical expertise while keeping description concise"

     **Example 2: Description Building (Both Have Descriptions + Sentences)**
     - Existing: description="Senior data scientist at Google", sentence="Sarah is a data scientist working on machine learning projects"
     - New: description="AI researcher with published papers", sentence="Sarah specializes in natural language processing and has published research papers"
     - Merged: "Senior data scientist at Google and AI researcher who specializes in machine learning and natural language processing with published research papers"
     - Reasoning: "Combined both existing descriptions with information from both sentences, prioritizing role, company, and expertise while keeping description focused and concise"

     **Example 3: Description Building (From Sentences Only)**
     - Existing: description=null, sentence="Sarah is a data scientist working on machine learning projects"
     - New: description=null, sentence="Sarah specializes in natural language processing and has published research papers"
     - Merged: "Data scientist specializing in machine learning and natural language processing with published research papers"
     - Reasoning: "Built focused description from both sentences, prioritizing core professional identity and expertise while keeping description concise"

     **Example 4: Description Quality (Core Facts vs Preferences)**
     - Existing: description="Jukka is married to Katy and works as a software engineer", sentence="Jukka likes Mexican food and enjoys hiking"
     - New: description=null, sentence="Jukka is developing AI applications and leads a team of engineers"
     - Merged: "Software engineer who is married to Katy and leads a team developing AI applications"
     - Reasoning: "Prioritized core facts (marriage, leadership role, technical expertise) over preferences (food, hobbies), keeping description focused on defining characteristics"


- `merged_description`: Combined description (use ALL available information - existing descriptions AND sentences from both nodes, or null only if no meaningful information available)
