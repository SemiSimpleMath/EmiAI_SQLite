Review multiple taxonomy classification candidates:

## Node to Classify
**Label:** {{ node_label }}
{% if node_category %}**Category:** {{ node_category }}{% endif %}
**Type:** {{ node_type }}
**Context:** {{ node_sentence }}

## Candidate Paths

The classification system found {{ candidates|length }} possible paths:

{% for candidate in candidates %}
**Candidate {{ candidate.rank }}**
**Path:** {{ candidate.path }}
**Taxonomy Structure:**
    {{ candidate.path_descriptions }}

{% endfor %}

## Your Task

Review all candidates and decide:
1. **APPROVE** one candidate if any are acceptable (specify which rank: 1, 2, 3, etc.)
2. **REJECT** all candidates if none are acceptable (path corrector will find a better path)

## Evaluation Criteria

For each candidate, ask:
- Does it follow proper IS-A relationships?
- Is it at an appropriate level of specificity?
- Does the node clearly fit in this taxonomy branch?
- Does the path make semantic sense?

**Remember:**
- **Entity taxonomy is flat**: `entity > person`, `entity > organization`, `entity > location` are LEAF nodes
  - Modifiers like "professional", "student", "adult" are **states** or **roles**, NOT entity subtypes
  - Example: A "professional person" is classified as `entity > person` (entity) + `state > role > professional` (state)
- **Compare candidates**: One might be clearly better than others
- **Judge semantic correctness**: Focus on IS-A relationships and fit
