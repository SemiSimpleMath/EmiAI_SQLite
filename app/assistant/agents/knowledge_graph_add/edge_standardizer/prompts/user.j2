## Edge to Standardize:

**Source Node**: {{ source_label }}
**Target Node**: {{ target_label }}
**Relationship Type**: {{ relationship_type }}
**Relationship Descriptor**: {{ relationship_descriptor }}
**Sentence**: {{ sentence }}

## Known Edge Variants (Dictionary):
{{ known_edge_variants }}

## Context for Disambiguation:
{{ context_text }}

---

Please standardize this edge relationship according to the rules:
1. Convert relationship_type to snake_case, lowercase
2. Check dictionary for known variants (map to canonical form)
3. Validate directionality (use source → target context)
4. If not in dictionary, determine if it's a synonym or truly new type
5. Provide relationship_descriptor if it adds useful context
6. Use the sentence and node labels to disambiguate

Return the standardized relationship_type with reasoning for any changes.
If you discover a new pattern that should be added to the dictionary, include it in dictionary_suggestion.
