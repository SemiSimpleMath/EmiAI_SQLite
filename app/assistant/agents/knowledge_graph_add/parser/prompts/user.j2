#### ENTITY CONTEXT SECTION ####
Information in this section is just to provide context.  It is facts from the knowledge graph we already have.
If it contains the information you are considering parsing, then do not parse the new information as it adds nothing but processing work.
However, if there is any new information worth adding to the knowledge graph then use the entity context section to help you write clear parsed
sentences for downstream agents.
