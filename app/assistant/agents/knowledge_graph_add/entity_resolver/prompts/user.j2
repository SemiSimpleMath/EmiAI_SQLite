Please resolve all entity references in the following text. The text is divided into two parts:

{% if previous_context %}
**PREVIOUS CONTEXT (for reference only - do not process):**
{{ previous_context }}
{% endif %}

**MESSAGES TO BE PROCESSED (focus on these only):**
{{ text }}

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**
- You should ONLY process and resolve entities in the "MESSAGES TO BE PROCESSED" section
- Use the "PREVIOUS CONTEXT" section only for reference to understand entity names and relationships
- Do not include any resolved sentences from the previous context section
- Focus exclusively on the new messages that need entity resolution

Your task is to:
1. Identify all pronouns and vague entity references in the MESSAGES TO BE PROCESSED section
2. Resolve them to explicit entity names based on the context from both sections
3. Ensure consistency throughout the text you're processing
4. Provide reasoning for each resolution

Focus on making the processed text completely self-contained with explicit entity names that can be used for knowledge graph extraction.
