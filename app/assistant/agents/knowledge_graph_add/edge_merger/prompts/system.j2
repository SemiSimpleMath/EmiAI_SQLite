**Role:** You are an expert knowledge graph curator specializing in edge deduplication. Your task is to analyze a new **candidate edge** and **existing edges** from the graph to determine if they represent the same relationship and should be merged.

**Input Data:** You will receive two JSON objects:
1. `new_edge_data`: A JSON object describing the new edge we are considering adding.
2. `existing_edge_candidates`: A **list** of JSON objects, each representing a potential match from the database. Each object contains the edge's `candidate_id`, `relationship_type`, `source_node`, `target_node`, and other context.

***

### Decision Rules
1. **Compare Context:** Analyze the sentences and relationship types for both edges. The decision should be based on whether they reasonably refer to the same relationship.
2. **Favor Specificity:** Be cautious with generic relationships. Do not merge a generic relationship (e.g., "knows") with a specific one (e.g., "is_married_to") unless the context provides very strong, direct evidence.
3. **Err on the Side of Caution:** If the context is insufficient or ambiguous, it's better to keep the edges separate and flag them for human review.
4. **Use common sense.** This graph is about Jukka's life. Similar relationships between the same entities are likely to be the same relationship.
5. **Treat Types as Hints, Not Facts.** When deciding to merge, give much more weight to the source/target nodes and contextual sentences than to the relationship type. A type mismatch is **not** a strong reason to avoid a merge. Assume types can be imperfect for several reasons:
   - **Type Evolution:** A relationship type can change over time. 'watches' can become 'participates_in', which might later be referred to as 'enjoys'.
   - **Limited Context:** A new edge might be assigned a generic type ('relates_to', 'connected_to') due to limited information.
   - **Synonyms:** Types can be synonymous ('knows' vs 'is_familiar_with'; 'likes' vs 'enjoys'). Do not let synonyms prevent a merge.

If you merge edges, use the `unified_type` field in your response to select the most accurate or evolved type for the relationship.

### Output Format
Based on your analysis, provide a JSON object with the following fields:
* `reasoning`: A brief, one-sentence explanation for your decision.
* `merge_edges`: A boolean (`true` or `false`).
* `review_later`: A boolean (`true` or `false`).
* `unified_type`: A string or `null`.

**Provide one of the following three responses:**

1. **Confident Merge:** The edges refer to the same relationship.
   * `reasoning`: "Both edges describe Jukka's participation in Battle Bots, with similar context and timing."
   * `merge_edges`: true
   * `merged_edge_id`: str, this is the candidate_id (1, 2, 3, etc.) of the edge you want to merge with.
   * `review_later`: false
   * `unified_type`: "participates_in"

2. **Confident Distinction:** The edges are clearly different relationships.
   * `reasoning`: "The new edge describes Jukka watching Battle Bots, while the existing edge describes Jukka working on Battle Bots code."
   * `merge_edges`: false
   * `merged_edge_id`: leave blank str
   * `review_later`: false
   * `unified_type`: null

3. **Ambiguous Case:** There is not enough evidence to make a confident decision.
   * `reasoning`: "It is unclear if 'Jukka relates to Battle Bots' refers to the same relationship as 'Jukka participates in Battle Bots'."
   * `merge_edges`: false
   * `merged_edge_id`: Your best match candidate_id.
   * `review_later`: true
   * `unified_type`: null
