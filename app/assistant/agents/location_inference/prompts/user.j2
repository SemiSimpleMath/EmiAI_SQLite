Current time: {{ date_time }}
Build a complete location timeline for the next {{ days_to_predict }} days.

{% if calendar_events %}
**Calendar Events** (you must infer locations from event names):
{% for event in calendar_events %}
- {{ event.date }} | {{ event.start_time }} - {{ event.end_time }} | "{{ event.event_name }}"{% if event.location_if_specified %} [Location: {{ event.location_if_specified }}]{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
{% else %}
No calendar events found.
{% endif %}

**Your Task**:
Analyze each event name and infer where the user will be. Use the guidelines you were given about:
- Known locations (e.g., "Peter's Broadway Arts" = Lake Forest, 25 min away)
- Work from home pattern
- Drop-off -> Home -> Pick-up pattern for kids' activities
- Travel times between locations

Build a COMPLETE timeline showing where the user will be at all times, including:
1. Time at home before leaving for events
2. Travel time TO events (leave early enough!)
3. Time at the event location
4. Travel time back home (or to next event)
5. Time at home between events

Each entry needs: start time, end time, location label, and brief reasoning.

IMPORTANT TIME RULES:
- You MUST output start_local/end_local in LOCAL time only.
- Format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
- Do NOT include "Z"
- Do NOT include timezone offsets like -08:00
- Python will convert local time to UTC after you respond.
