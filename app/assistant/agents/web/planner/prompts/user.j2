{% if checklist %}
This is our previous checklist that you have to now update. You may also add sub-goals to the checklist. Do not get stuck thinking you must check off every single part. Often main goal can be achieved by abandoning some goals or sub-goals or deciding that a check item has been closely enough satisfied.

This is our first action. We have not done anything yet. So summary will be blank. We just need to come up with a plan and action.

{% if recent_history %}
Things that happened since last time you made a plan from oldest to latest. Last thing is most recent tool result that you have to evaluate:
{{ recent_history }}
We now have tool result, take verbatim most important things and save in summary.

CRITICAL: You have reached the 15-action limit! You must now wrap up and complete your task even if not fully done. No more tool calls - set action to flow_exit_node.
