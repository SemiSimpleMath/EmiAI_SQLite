Please analyze the following Knowledge Graph entity and decide whether to create an entity card for it:

ENTITY INFORMATION:
- Name: {{ entity_name }}
- Type: {{ entity_type }}
- Description: {{ entity_description }}
- Aliases: {{ entity_aliases }}

RELATIONSHIPS:
{{ relationships_data }}

**FIRST**: Decide whether this entity should have a card created. Consider:
- Would this entity name be useful for prompt injection? (e.g., "Katy" - yes, "dad" - no)
- Is it a specific, identifiable entity or a generic term?
- Would injecting this entity's information enhance conversation context?

**IF YOU DECIDE TO CREATE A CARD**, please generate:
1. A comprehensive summary of this entity
2. Key facts about the entity
3. A structured summary of important relationships
4. Relevant metadata

**IF YOU DECIDE NOT TO CREATE A CARD**, set should_create_card to false and provide a brief explanation in the summary field.

Focus on creating entity cards that would be highly useful when injected into prompts about this entity, avoiding noise from generic terms.
