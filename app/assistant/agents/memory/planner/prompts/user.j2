This is our previous checklist that you have to now update. You may also add sub-goals to the checklist. Do not get stuck thinking you must check off every single part. Often main goal can be achieved by abandoning some goals or sub-goals or deciding that a check item has been closely enough satisfied.
{{ checklist }}

Things that happened since last time you made a plan from oldest to latest. Last thing is most recent tool result that you have to evaluate:
{{ recent_history }}

We now have tool result, take verbatim most important things and save in summary.

{% if action_count %}
**Action Count:** {{ action_count }}/20 (You have {{ 20 - action_count }} actions remaining)
{% endif %}

{% if action_count and action_count >= 20 %}
CRITICAL: You have reached the 20-action limit! You must now wrap up and complete your task even if not fully done. No more tool calls - set action to flow_exit_node.
