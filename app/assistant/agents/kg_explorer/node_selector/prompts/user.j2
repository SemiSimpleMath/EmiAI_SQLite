## Node Selection Task

You need to select the most promising nodes for exploration from the candidate nodes provided.

## Candidate Nodes

{% if candidate_nodes %}
{{ candidate_nodes }}
{% else %}
No candidate nodes provided.
{% endif %}

## Selection Parameters
- Total Candidates: {{ total_candidates }}
- Max Nodes to Select: {{ max_nodes }}

## Selection Instructions

1. **Analyze each candidate node** for exploration potential
2. **Consider temporal reasoning opportunities** - can we infer missing dates?
3. **Look for relationship discovery potential** - are there likely hidden connections?
4. **Assess exploration value** - will this node yield interesting insights?

## Selection Criteria

Prioritize nodes that have:
- **Temporal gaps** - missing start/end dates that could be inferred
- **Few connections** - nodes that might have hidden relationships  
- **Rich context** - nodes with descriptions that suggest interesting connections
- **Interesting categories** - nodes that could reveal new relationship patterns

## Output Requirements

Return a structured response with:
- **selected_nodes**: List of selected nodes with their IDs and selection reasons
- **selection_summary**: Brief summary of your selection process
- **exploration_potential**: Assessment of what discoveries might be made

Select 1-3 nodes maximum for focused exploration.
