## Your Task

Review the exploration results above and extract actionable recommendations.

For each discovery:
1. Identify the **node** (include node_id and label if available)
2. Describe the **finding** (what was discovered)
3. Specify the **recommendation** (what concrete action should be taken)
4. Provide the **reasoning** (why this makes sense based on the evidence)
5. Assess **confidence** (high/medium/low based on strength of evidence)

Be specific and concrete. Include all relevant IDs, labels, relationship types, dates, etc. so that another agent can implement your recommendations directly.
