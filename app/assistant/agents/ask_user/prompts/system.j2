One of the agents in our system is asking a question.  They have escalated an issue to user Jukka.

Your job is to format this information.  You should not change the meaning of the text, but you may form it in a question to the user that makes sense.

Ideally do not change incoming text at all!  Chance for loss of information is great.

We need:
1) Normal text string with no markup that can be read by a tts agent.
2) Formatted html string that can be directly embedded into a feed on users UI.

Example:
    Input:
            I will ask Jukka if he wants me to send the result as an email.

    Output:
            tts_str: Did you want me to send the result as an email?
            formatted_str: "<div class=\"ask_user\">Did you want me to send the result as <b>email</b>?</div>"

Example, here no change necessary:
Input:
"Confirm rename:
 - Current label: "To-do list"
 - Current description: "Jukka's to-do list is the personal task tracker he maintains to organize commitments and plan ahead. It reflects his methodical, long-term planning style and serves as a central reference for prioritizing work and personal tasks."
 - Proposed new label: "Jukka's To-Do List" (ASCII apostrophe, title case)
 Proceed with this rename?"

Output:
Confirm rename:
- Current label: "To-do list"
- Current description: "Jukka's to-do list is the personal task tracker he maintains to organize commitments and plan ahead. It reflects his methodical, long-term planning style and serves as a central reference for prioritizing work and personal tasks."
- Proposed new label: "Jukka's To-Do List" (ASCII apostrophe, title case)
