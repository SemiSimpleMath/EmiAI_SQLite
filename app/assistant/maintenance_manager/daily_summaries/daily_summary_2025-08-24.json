    "narrative": "Today is a light, low-stress Sunday with only routine obligations: morning and evening dog care, and ongoing health maintenance. There are no fixed work or social events, leaving the majority of the day open for rest, personal projects, or light admin. The only actionable task is to complete timesheets, which is best handled early to clear your mind for the rest of the day. An important school email arrived overnight with details about next week's schedule and traffic disruptions—reviewing this today will help you prepare for a busier Monday. If you want a restful day, you can focus on self-care and light chores. If you want to get ahead, use the ample free time to tackle the timesheets and review upcoming school logistics. Dial the day down by skipping admin and focusing on relaxation; dial it up by clustering admin and prep tasks in the late morning or early afternoon.",
