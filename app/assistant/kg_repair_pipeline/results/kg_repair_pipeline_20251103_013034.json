      "problem_description": "The node labeled 'Preference' is problematic due to its overly generic label and semantic label, both of which fail to specify the nature of the preference. The absence of a description further reduces clarity. The node does not adhere to the preferred '[Category] Preference' naming convention, making it difficult to understand or use in downstream applications.",
      "resolution_notes": "1. Update the label to specify the nature of the preference, e.g., 'Explicit Instruction Only Preference'. 2. Add a clear and concise description explaining what the preference entails (e.g., 'A preference that Emi does not take action unless explicitly instructed by Jukka.'). 3. Add or update the semantic label to reflect the specific preference. 4. Ensure the node follows the '[Category] Preference' naming convention for consistency."
