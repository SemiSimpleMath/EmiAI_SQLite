      "problem_description": "The node represents a video game entity but uses the full game title as both its label and semantic_label. The label should be a minimal type descriptor ('Video Game'), and the semantic_label should provide the specific context ('Video Game (Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales)'). This improves clarity and consistency in the knowledge graph.",
