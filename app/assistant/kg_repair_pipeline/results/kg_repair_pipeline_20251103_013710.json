      "problem_description": "The node has multiple data quality issues: the label is too generic, the semantic label is not descriptive, and the description is missing. While temporal information is present, the lack of specificity and context reduces the node's usefulness and clarity.",
      "resolution_notes": "1. Replace the generic label 'Ownership' with a more specific label, such as 'Ownership of semisimplemath@gmail.com by Jukka'. 2. Add a clear, concise description explaining the state, e.g., 'Jukka is the owner of the email account semisimplemath@gmail.com as of 2025-11-02.' 3. Add or update the semantic label to reflect the specific ownership relationship. 4. Consider adding aliases if there are common alternative phrasings."
