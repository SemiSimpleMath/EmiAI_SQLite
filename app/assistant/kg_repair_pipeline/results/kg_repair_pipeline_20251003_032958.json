      "problem_description": "The node has multiple data quality issues: (1) The label 'Likes sushi' is not a minimal type and instead describes a specific instance. (2) The semantic label 'intangible' is too generic and does not follow the expected format (should be something like 'Preference (Jukka, Sushi)'). (3) Temporal information is incomplete, as it only states 'ongoing as of 2025-02-28' without a clear start_date or end_date.",
