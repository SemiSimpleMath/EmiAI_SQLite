For example: \"A personal task-tracking document maintained by Jukka to organize and prioritize work and personal tasks; it serves as his central reference for planning.\" Remove evaluative phrasing like \"methodical, long-term planning style.\"\n- Standardize punctuation to ASCII (change \"Jukka’s\" to \"Jukka's\").\n- Add aliases to aid discoverability while remaining specific, e.g., [\"Jukka's to-do list\", \"Jukka task tracker\", \"Jukka's task tracker\"].\n- Keep Type: Entity and Category: document unchanged."
