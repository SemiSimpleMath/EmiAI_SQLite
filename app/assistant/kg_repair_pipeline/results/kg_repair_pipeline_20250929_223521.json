      "problem_description": "The node 'To-do list' (Entity, category=document) has no attributes and lacks a description, making it generic and underspecified. It has only one connection, which points to another node with the same label/type, indicating a likely duplicate or a circular self-edge. The use of node_type 'Entity' appears too generic relative to the provided ontology; a 'Document' class (if available) or a more precise type should be used. Expected relationships (owner/person Jukka, platform/app, contains Task nodes, classification) are missing.",

      "resolution_notes": "1) Verify identity and provenance: check ingestion logs/source to determine intended semantics of node 38ece277-d9b9-4938-b4db-9f2309fe8859. 2) If it is a valid concept, enrich with required fields: name/title, description/summary, type/class per ontology (e.g., Document/Task/etc.), category, created_at/updated_at, source_system/source_uri, owner/author, and confidence. 3) Attach necessary relationships based on evidence: link to Person (owner/author), platform/app, container/collection, and contained items (e.g., Task nodes) as applicable. 4) Structural cleanup: if any self-loop or duplicate edges are discovered during review, remove them; run duplicate detection (by normalized title/metadata) and merge with canonical node if a duplicate exists, preserving provenance. 5) If no corroborating data is found and the node remains empty, deprecate or delete it to avoid clutter; record the action in audit logs. 6) Update node_type from generic 'Entity' to the correct ontology class; ensure category aligns with class. 7) Add provenance and data-quality flags; include confidence and last_verified timestamps. 8) Run an orphan-node sweep to catch similar cases and prevent recurrence in the pipeline."
