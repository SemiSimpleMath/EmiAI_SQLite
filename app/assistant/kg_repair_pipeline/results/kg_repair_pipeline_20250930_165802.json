      "resolution_notes": "- Rename label to a disambiguated instance label, e.g., \"Jukka's to-do list\" or \"To-do list (Jukka)\", per graph naming conventions.\n- Change Type from Entity to Document (or the schema's specific class for documents/personal documents) to align with Category: document.\n- Add aliases such as: \"Jukka's task list\", \"Jukka to-do list\", \"Personal to-do list\".\n- Revise description to be objective and concise, e.g., \"A personal task list maintained by Jukka to track and prioritize work and personal commitments; updated on an ongoing basis.\"\n- Improve connectivity:\n  - instance_of -> To-do list (concept) [if such a concept node exists]\n  - maintained_by/owned_by -> Jukka (Person)\n  - used_for -> Task management / Personal productivity (concepts)\n  - contains -> Task nodes (if tasks are modeled as nodes)\n  - stored_in -> the application or storage location, if known (otherwise leave unset).\n- Check for duplication: if a generic concept node named \"To-do list\" exists, ensure this node is the instance and the concept node remains separate.\n- Keep temporal fields unset (not required for a document) and note that empty attributes are acceptable.\n- Consider adding clearer provenance if available (e.g., user_provided, system_of_record), since 'processed_entity_log' is generic."
