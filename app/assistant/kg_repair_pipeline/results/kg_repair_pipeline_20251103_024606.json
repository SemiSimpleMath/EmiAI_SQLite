      "problem_description": "The node 'Taking Lessons' has multiple data quality issues: it lacks a description, has a generic and non-specific label and semantic label, and is missing explicit temporal information (start_date and end_date). These deficiencies make the node ambiguous and less useful in the knowledge graph.",
      "resolution_notes": "1. Add a clear and specific description, e.g., 'State in which Annika is participating in art lessons.' 2. Update the label to be more specific, such as 'Taking Art Lessons' or 'Annika Taking Art Lessons.' 3. Assign an appropriate semantic label, such as 'education_participation' or 'art_lesson_participation.' 4. Add explicit temporal information: start_date (when lessons began) and end_date (when lessons ended or are expected to end)."
