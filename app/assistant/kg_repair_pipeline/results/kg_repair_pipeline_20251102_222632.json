Without a description, users cannot discern what kind of therapy is meant (e.g., physical, psychological, etc.), and the node lacks the specificity needed for a useful Concept node.",
      "resolution_notes": "Add a clear, concise description to the node that defines what is meant by 'Therapy' in this context. If the node is intended to represent a specific type of therapy, update the label and category to reflect that specificity (e.g., 'Psychotherapy', 'Physical Therapy'). If it is meant to be a general concept, provide a description that encompasses the broad meaning and consider linking to or creating more specific sub-nodes for different therapy types."
