The label and description clearly indicate it is an event, and the category field supports this. No temporal information is provided, but the primary issue is misclassification.",

Add temporal information if available, such as start_date and/or end_date, to improve data quality for this event node. 3. Ensure the description is clear and specific about the event's nature, participants, and timing if possible."
