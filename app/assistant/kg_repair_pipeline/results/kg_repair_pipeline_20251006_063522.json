      "problem_description": "The node has two main data quality issues: (1) The label 'Calendar use' is not a minimal, singular type/class and is phrased as an action rather than a state or property. (2) The semantic_label 'use_action' is overly generic and does not provide instance-specific context, such as the person involved. Temporal information is present and description is clear, but labeling does not meet KG standards.",
