      "problem_description": "The node is not missing critical quality metrics (confidence, importance, source) and is not an Event/State/Goal, so temporal fields are not required. However, it exhibits multiple data quality issues: incomplete attributes (empty), no aliases/description, a generic label ('To-do list') causing ambiguity, only one connection (weak connectivity), missing expected relationships (owner and contained tasks), and a suspected duplicate/self-loop with the neighbor node that has the same label and type.",
      "priority": "critical",
      "resolution_notes": "- Verify intended semantics: determine what this entity represents (e.g., a task list) and whether it should exist.\n- Populate essential attributes per schema: name/title, description, aliases (if applicable), source/provenance, confidence, importance, created_at/updated_at.\n- Replace overly generic type/category if needed: consider a more specific type (e.g., TaskList/List/Document) rather than generic 'Entity'.\n- Fix structure: establish required relationships (e.g., owner -> Person/Agent; contains -> Task items). Ensure no self-loops; with edge_count=0 this is currently moot, but validate after adding edges.\n- Dedup check before adding edges: query for nodes with similar or identical normalized names/titles; if a duplicate exists, merge records and reconcile attributes/edges; otherwise proceed to enrich this node.\n- If no supporting evidence is found and the node remains without attributes or relationships, consider deleting it to reduce orphan clutter.\n- Add QA rules: flag orphan nodes with empty attribute sets and missing provenance as high-priority for remediation in future ingests."
