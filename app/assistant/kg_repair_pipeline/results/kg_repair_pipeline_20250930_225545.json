      "resolution_notes": "Recommended repairs:\n1) Relabel to a specific, disambiguated title using Title Case and ASCII punctuation, e.g., \"Jukka's To-Do List\" (preferred) or \"Jukka - To-Do List\". If multiple lists exist, add a disambiguator such as platform or year, e.g., \"Jukka's To-Do List (Notion)\".\n2) Add aliases to preserve findability and accommodate variants: [\"To-do list\" (previous label), \"Todo list\", \"Task list\", \"Jukka todo list\", \"Jukka task list\"].\n3) Tweak the description for clarity and objectivity and to use ASCII apostrophes: \"Jukka's personal task tracker used to organize and prioritize work and personal tasks; serves as his central reference for planning.\" Avoid speculative details about platform unless known.\n4) Keep Type: Entity and Category: document as-is.\n5) Ensure hyphenation/casing consistency for 'To-Do' across label and aliases per project style guide."
