However, the label is generic and may be mistaken for the general concept, creating potential misclassification or ambiguity. No temporal fields are required for this node type.",
      "resolution_notes": "- Rename the label to a specific, disambiguated form per naming conventions, e.g., \"Jukka's To-Do List\" or \"To-Do List (Jukka)\". \n- Add aliases to capture common variants: \"To-do list\", \"To-Do List\", \"Todo list\", \"Personal to-do list\".\n- Add/ensure a relationship to the Person node for Jukka (owned_by/maintained_by/authored_by) to establish ownership.\n- If a concept node for the general idea exists, link via instance_of: To-do list (concept)/Task list to prevent conflation.\n- Add connections to the platform or location where the list is maintained (e.g., hosted_on: Notion/Google Tasks/Apple Reminders; stored_at: URL if applicable).\n- Review for potential duplicate nodes with similar labels and merge or disambiguate if found.\n- Optionally refine the description to include scope (work/personal), primary platform, and current status (active), if known.\n- Consider adjusting importance upward if this is indeed a central reference for prioritizing tasks, based on curator judgment."
