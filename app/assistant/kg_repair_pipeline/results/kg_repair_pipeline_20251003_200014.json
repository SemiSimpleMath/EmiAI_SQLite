      "problem_description": "The node has two main data quality issues: (1) The label is a verb phrase ('Manages recurring events') rather than a minimal, reusable type (e.g., 'Management' or 'Scheduling'). (2) The semantic_label is overly generic ('intangible') and does not provide instance-specific context, such as referencing the person or activity involved. Temporal information is present and appropriate for a State node.",
