      "problem_description": "The node represents a specific personal document but is labeled generically as \"To-do list,\" creating ambiguity with the concept of to-do lists. Classification as an Entity and category as document are appropriate. No temporal fields are required for Entities. Main issues are inconsistent/ambiguous naming and a somewhat subjective description.",
      "resolution_notes": "- Rename label to a specific, disambiguated form, e.g., \"Jukka's To-Do List\" (use consistent title casing and hyphenation).\n- Add aliases to aid discovery and capture common variants, e.g., [\"To-do list (Jukka)\", \"Jukka task list\", \"Jukka's todo list\", \"Personal to-do list (Jukka)\", \"To do list (Jukka)\"]\n- Revise description to be concise and neutral, focusing on the document rather than personal traits. Example: \"A personal task list maintained by Jukka to organize and prioritize work and personal commitments; serves as a central reference for planning.\"\n- Keep type: Entity and category: document as-is unless your schema supports a more specific type like \"Document\"; if so, consider updating type accordingly for consistency.\n- Include a brief disambiguation note in the description (e.g., \"This node refers to Jukka's specific task list, not the general concept of to-do lists.\")\n- Standardize capitalization and hyphenation (\"To-Do\" vs \"To-do\"; pick the project-wide convention and apply it)."
