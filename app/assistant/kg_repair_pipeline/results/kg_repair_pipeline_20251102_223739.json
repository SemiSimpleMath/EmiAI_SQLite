      "problem_description": "The node 'Has multiple dogs' is intended to represent an ongoing state of pet ownership for Jukka. However, it is missing explicit start_date and end_date fields, which are required for State nodes to define the temporal extent of the state. The 'valid_during' field only provides a single assertion date, not a range. The label is also longer than recommended, bordering on malformed.",
      "resolution_notes": "1. Add explicit start_date (when Jukka began owning multiple dogs) and, if known, end_date (when this state ended or will end). If the state is ongoing, set end_date to null or leave it open. 2. Change the label to a more concise, noun-based form such as 'Dog ownership' or 'Multiple dog ownership'. 3. Optionally, add an alias 'Has multiple dogs' for searchability, but do not use it as the primary label."
