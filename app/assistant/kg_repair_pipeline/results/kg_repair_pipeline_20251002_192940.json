Temporal data includes a start_date and an as-of valid_during marker, but no end_date is provided, which leaves the state open-ended per the criteria. The label is generic and does not clearly identify the subject (Jukka), target (Jouko), or the context (prank email, 2025-02-28), reducing clarity and disambiguation. Description is clear and non-contradictory.",
