      "resolution_notes": "- Rename label to a disambiguated form, e.g., \"Jukka's to-do list\" (or follow project casing standard, e.g., \"Jukka - To-Do List\").\n- Rewrite description to concise, neutral language, e.g., \"A personal task tracker maintained by Jukka for organizing and prioritizing work and personal tasks.\" Avoid subjective phrasing about planning style.\n- Standardize punctuation to ASCII (replace curly apostrophes) and apply consistent capitalization per naming guidelines (e.g., To-Do vs To-do).\n- Add aliases for findability: [\"Jukka's todo list\", \"To do list\", \"Todo list\", \"Task list\", \"Personal to-do list\"].\n- Add/verify key relationships:\n  - owned_by -> Person: Jukka\n  - maintained_in/hosted_on -> the tool or platform if known (e.g., Notion/Obsidian/Google Tasks); else add an attribute placeholder.\n  - tracks/organizes -> existing Task/Project nodes or a \"Personal productivity system\" node if present.\n- Review source: replace or supplement \"processed_entity_log\" with a more specific source (e.g., the actual repository/app or user-provided confirmation). If uncertain, lower confidence or add a verification note.\n- If there is also a concept-level node for the generic idea \"To-do list\", ensure this document node is clearly distinguished and not conflated (use category/document vs concept/class and explicit owner).\n- Optionally add created_on/last_updated if known, but not required."
