Type Entity with category document is plausible if it is an instance. No temporal data is required since it is not an Event/State/Goal. Content is generally clear but could be more specific and normalized.",
      "resolution_notes": "Recommended repairs:\n- Disambiguate label: rename to a unique, owner-specific title, e.g., \"Jukka To-Do List\" or \"To-do list (Jukka)\"; avoid curly apostrophes; keep consistent capitalization.\n- Add aliases: [\"Jukka’s to-do list\", \"Jukka task list\", \"Personal to-do list (Jukka)\"] for lookup.\n- Ontology typing: if available, set Type to a more specific class (e.g., Document or List/PersonalDocument) rather than generic Entity; keep category=document.\n- Ownership/author edges: add maintained_by/owned_by -> Person:Jukka; optionally created_by.\n- Storage/source metadata: add source/system (e.g., Notion, Trello, local file), canonical identifier/URL, created_at, updated_at, format, language.\n- Access/sensitivity: add confidentiality tag (e.g., personal/private) and access policy.\n- Neutralize description: remove subjective phrasing (\"reflects his methodical style\") or add provenance/confidence; keep description concise and factual (purpose and scope).\n- Relationships: if tasks exist as nodes, link via includes/tracks/organizes edges; otherwise, at least link to relevant projects or domains.\n- Normalization: ensure consistent hyphenation/spelling (\"to-do\"), ASCII punctuation in label, and casing per naming conventions."
