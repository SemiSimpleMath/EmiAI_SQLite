- For more action games metal.

### Morning
- Lighter rock - Foo Fighters, Coldplay, The Shins
- Classic rock - Beatles, Dire Straits
- Nothing too heavy early

### Evening Wind-Down
- Mellower stuff - Radiohead, Pink Floyd, Cowboy Junkies
- Acoustic versions
- Nothing too aggressive after 9 PM

## Guidelines
- prefer rock/alternative over pop
- Grunge era (Nirvana, Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden) is a sweet spot
- 90's and early 2000's alternative
- Mix in variety - don't play same artist twice in a row
- Metal is great for gaming, not for working
- Classic rock legends (Pink Floyd, Beatles, Dire Straits) always welcome

## Avoid
- Mainstream pop
- Country
- EDM/dance music
- Overly repetitive tracks
