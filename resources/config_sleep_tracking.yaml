# Sleep Tracking Configuration
# Minimal parameters to detect sleep intervals and when user is actually up

# Sleep Window
# AFK during this period counts as sleep
sleep_window:
  start: "22:30"  # 10:30 PM
  end: "09:00"    # 9:00 AM

# Sleep/Awake Divider
# After this time, AFK is treated as awake time rather than sleep.
sleep_awake_divider: "05:30"

# Minimum AFK duration to count as sleep (minutes)
# Sleep-like AFK must be this long AND overlap with sleep window
min_sleep_afk_minutes: 60  # 1 hour minimum

# Minimum overlap ratio with sleep window to classify as sleep
# 0.60 = at least 60% of AFK period must overlap with sleep window
min_sleep_overlap_ratio: 0.60

# AFK Detection Thresholds
# These control when the system considers the user "away"
afk_thresholds:
  is_potentially_afk_minutes: 1  # Grace period - wellness cycle pauses but user not yet considered AFK
  confirmed_afk_minutes: 3       # User is confirmed AFK

# AFK-based activity resets
# If user was away from the computer for >= min_minutes, reset timers for activities
# that have reset_on_afk: true in config_tracked_activities.json (e.g., stretches).
afk_resets:
  min_minutes: 10

# Normal Sleep Hours
# Used for cold start assumptions and calculating expected wake time
normal_sleep:
  start: "22:30"  # Typical bedtime
  end: "07:30"    # Typical wake time
  duration_hours: 8.5  # Default assumption for cold starts

# Greeting Messages
greetings:
  # After confirmed awake
  morning_greeting: "☀️ Good morning! How did you sleep last night?"
  
  # Early wake (before ambiguous window, deprecated)
  early_contact: "You're up very early. Are you getting up or planning to go back to sleep?"

# Administrative Daily Reset
# Fixed time for resetting daily counters (separate from behavioral wake logic)
daily_reset:
  hour: 5  # 5 AM - when daily counters reset
