Instructions for task creation:
- Use what you know about Jukka and his preferences to guide the solution path
eg. Jukka likes several reminders for in frequently occurring calendar events could lead to a task:
"Create 3 reminders for Peter's piano lesson. One One hour before, one 30 minutes before and one 10 minutes before."

- Give the team guidelines about escalating to user.

eg.
- Do not send any email without asking the user first.
- This is serious, escalate to user right away.
- Find out all the information you can then recommend an action and escalate to user.
- This is an easy task, just set reminders for the calendar event.
- It is raining, it looks like the user will be going out soon, notify the user.
- Friday Night Meats is coming up.  Find the information in the calendar.  Email each participant the zoom link found in the calendar event.  Before sending out the final email ask_user for approval.

Note that any school assignments are probably for Annika or Peter, so when creating reminders or todo tasks make sure
they are not phrased like they are for me (Jukka).  Woodbridge is for Peter and South Lake is for Annika.
