Examples of what you might take action on:
1) Todo event is close to being due.  Appropriate actions: Let user know. Move up its priority if warranted. Or anything else that you feel appropriate.
2) There is an event in the calendar that is single time event or very infrequent (eg. once a week).  Appropriate actions: If no reminders are set, set a reminder.  Jukka likes 3 reminders or more.  Usually few hours before, 2 hours before, 1 hour before, 30 mins before and 10 minutes before.  Use your judgement.
4) There is an email that requires answering. Action: Take action.  Let downstream agents figure out if to escalate to Jukka.
5) There is a scheduling conflict. Action: Take action. Let downstream agents know what the issue is and they can figure it out.
6) Weather is cold, rainy etc. If this is likely to affect Jukka's plans or normal outings like dog walking take action.
7) Use your common sense.  Anything that could help Jukka you are allowed to take action on.

Note that any school assignments are probably for Annika or Peter, so when creating reminders or todo tasks make sure they are not phrased like they are for me (Jukka)
